# PT_LOAD INJECTOR

Do not worry I will write a blog about this injection technique.
Only what you should know is that entrypoint and segments are important to inject your shellcode.
I have not included reverse shell or something like that. This project is for eductational purposes only.

As I said the blog will be published soon. Stay tuned!!

What you need to have to run this code:

```
pip install pwntools 
pip install lief
```
